# TDD rules:
1. One is not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. One is not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. One is not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
# Features
1. Adds two numbers in string format
2. Supports empty, single , multiple number string
3. Has delimiters as comma, newline, slashes
